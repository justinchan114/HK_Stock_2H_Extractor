# HK_Stock_Income_Statement_Extractor (1H/2H/FY)
When analyzing Hong Kong stocks, I often need to compare income statements at half-year intervals (Most of the HK stocks provide half year and yearly statements only, but not quarterly). However, most websites provide results for the first half (1H) and the full year (FY), but rarely separate out the second half(2H) results. Therefore, I decided to build this little scraper with jupyter notebook to obtain income statements from etnet.com.hk for a stock, and clean the data frame for my own analysis.
The output is in csv format.
